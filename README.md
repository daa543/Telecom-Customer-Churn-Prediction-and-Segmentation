# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Segmentation

This project involves analyzing a telecommunications dataset to understand customer churn patterns. The analysis begins with data exploration to inspect the structure and quality of the dataset.

We applied Supervised Learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and comparing between the three models using GridSearch to find the best model and displaying its evaluation.

We also applied Unsupervised Learning Models like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
